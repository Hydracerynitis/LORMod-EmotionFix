    <Description>In this Mod, I give Guests the ability to apply random abnormality cards when leveling up in battle
The intensity of how frequent guest acquire can be config through Difficulty.txt
All emotion cards have been tweaked to ensure every Guest are able to gain an advantage from it,
They may have an entirely different ability from the emotion cards Librarian harnessed

Enjoy -----by Hydracerynitis
