Thanks for downloading My mod.

In this Mod, I give Guests the ability to apply random abnormality cards when leveling up in battle
The intensity of how frequent guest acquire can be config through Difficulty.txt
All emotion cards have been tweaked to ensure every Guest are able to gain advantage from it,
They may have a entirely different ability from the emotion cards Librarian harnessed

I also reworked mulitiples abnormality cards, rebalance thier power and change the distribution of them across mental state and 
emotion level.
